  Basic support library for Elisa Compiler

***  Neil Johnson <neil@njohnson.co.uk>  ***

To use the functions in this library you must include them into
your source code.

For example, if your platform supports the C preprocessor "cpp" then
you can use it with the "-I${PATH_TO_ELISA}/lib" flag and use
	#include <printnum.el>
in your source code.
